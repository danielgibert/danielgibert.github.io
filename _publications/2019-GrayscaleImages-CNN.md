Malicious files belonging to the same family, with the same malicious behavior, are constantly modified or obfuscated using several
techniques, in such a way that they look like different files (different hash).

In this paper, malicious software is visualized as gray scale images since its ability to capture minor changes while
retaining the global structure helps to detect variations. Motivated by the visual similarity between malware samples of the
same family, we propose a deep learning approach for malware categorization to efficiently group malicious
software into families based on a set of discriminant patterns extracted from their visualization as images.
