In this paper, we present a systematic review of machine learning (M.L.) approaches for malware detection.
We classify traditional approaches into static, dynamic and hybrid approaches.
We provide a detailed description of the features in a traditional M.L. workflow.
We introduce new research directions such as deep learning and multimodal approaches.
We discuss the research issues and challenges faced by security researchers.
