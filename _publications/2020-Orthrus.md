We introduce Orthrus, a bimodal approach for malware categorization based on deep learning.
Orthrus combines two modalities of data: 
* The byte sequence representing the malware's binary content
* The assembly language instructions extracted from the assembly language source code of malware
Orthrus performs automatic feature learning and classification with a convolutional neural network.
