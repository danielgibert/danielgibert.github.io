<p>My main area of research lies at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and Information Security.
My work has focused on building, attacking, and defending malware detectors.</p>
<h1 id="adversarial-attacks-and-defenses-for-malware-detection">Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for Malware Detection</h1>
<p>I am currently conducting research on attacks and defenses for malware detection. Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - attacks that intentionally manipulate the input data to cause the model to misclassify or produce incorrect outputs.
Machine learning-based malware detectors are no exception. </p>
<p>I have developed methods to attack feature-based detectors without having to query the target detector and without requiring knowledge of the model&#39;s parameters using <a href="/publication/2023-IEEE-Security-And-Privacy-Workshops">Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</a>. </p>
<p>I have developed methods to defend against adversarial attacks on end-to-end malware detectors based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/publication/2024-ESORICS-RandomizedSmoothing">Randomized smoothing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/publication/2024-IEEEAccess-DeRandomizedSmoothing">(De)randomized smoothing</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>I have proposed the <a href="/publication/2024-AISEC-DeRandomizedSmoothing">first deterministic robustness certificate for end-to-end malware detectors</a> and I have investigated the limitations of static machine learning-based detectors against <a href="/publication/2024-Packing">packing</a>.</p>
<h1 id="machine-learning-for-malware-detection-and-classification">Machine Learning for Malware Detection and Classification</h1>
<p>During my PhD, I focused on the design, implementation, and evaluation of ML-based approaches for the task of malware classification. I developed methods to classify malware based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/publication/2017-CNN-Opcodes">Assembly code of the binary files</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/publication/2018-StructuralEntropy">Structural entropy representation of the binary files</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/publication/2020-Grayscale-Images-CNN">Grayscale images of the binary files</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/publication/2020-HYDRA">Hand-crafted features and deep learning</a>.</li>
</ul>
